          "content": "Hello, I’m a junior at TJHSST interested in CS, SWE, competitive programming, robotics, and control theory. . In my free time I like to study Japanese, read manga, and listen to music. I used to be a huge anime fan but sadly school has left me with barely any time for it. Nevertheless you can find my MyAnimeList account here. . On the side, I love listening to Japanese 80s City Pop, Jazz Fusion, and Future Funk. Here’s my spotify playlist if interested. My favorite artists are Junko Yagami, Momoko Kikuchi, Bread and Butter, Yuri Tanaka, and Wink! . I also like to create YouTube videos for fun, centering on robotics or a project im working on. Here is my youtube channel .",
