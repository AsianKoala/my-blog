Hello,
I'm currently a student at TJHSST interested in CS, SWE, competitive programming, robotics, and control theory.

In my free time I like to study Japanese, read manga, and listen to music. I used to be a huge anime fan but sadly
school has left me with barely any time for it. Nevertheless you can find my 
[MyAnimeList account here](https://myanimelist.net/profile/asiank0ala). 

On the side, I love listening to Japanese 80s City Pop, Jazz Fusion, and Future Funk. Here's my 
[spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bhQNpSKPFjWx6sCBUhOA3?si=d2e509332ee248b4) if interested.
My favorite artists are Junko Yagami, Momoko Kikuchi, Bread and Butter, Yuri Tanaka, and Wink!

I also like to create YouTube videos for fun, centering on robotics or a project im working on.
