Hello,
I'm currently a student at TJHSST interested in CS, control theory, and competitive programming.

In my free time I like to study Japanese, read manga, and [rice Linux](https://github.com/AsianKoala/dotfiles). You can find me on MAL at [@asiank0ala](https://myanimelist.net/profile/asiank0ala). 

I love listening to Japanese 80s City Pop and Jazz Fusion. Here's my 
[spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bhQNpSKPFjWx6sCBUhOA3?si=d2e509332ee248b4) 
and [youtube music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDJ5RHUdb1FqhWZim6Lwak5g7QJOYIEu) if interested.

On my youtube channel, I post a variety of videos ranging from robotics videos to osu highlights.
