Hello,
I'm a junior at TJHSST interested in CS, SWE, competitive programming, and robotics.

At TJ I'm the lead programmer of FTC team 14607, and this is my 4th year in the FTC program. Over the past few years
I've achieved numerous awards in FTC, such as WAC (Winning Alliance Captain) at the Virginia States competition in my
rookie year, top 50% at the World Championship, and have consistently reached the States competition since I started out
in the program.

In my free time I like reading manga and brushing up on my Japanese. I used to be a huge anime fan (you can check my
MyAnimeList account [here](https://myanimelist.net/profile/asiank0ala), but recently I've found myself getting
bored with anime.

I also like to create YouTube videos for fun, mainly about either documenting myself working on a CS project or creating
small tutorials on topics I'm well-versed on.

The 2 big projects that I'm working on currently are my FTC team's <a
    href=https://github.com/14607/FTC_14607>codebase</a>, which is written in Kotlin, and an Electron app called <a
    href=https://github.com/AsianKoala/anime-dl>anime-dl</a>, which's main purpose is to automatically find all safe and
high quality torrents relating to an anime, such as different seasons, OVAs, specials, etc.

Here are some other projects that I'm slowly making.
<a href=https://github.com/AsianKoala/debugger-bundle>debugger-bundle</a>, a JavaFX desktop app used to virtually
simulate a 2D robot moving across a field.
<a href=https://github.com/AsianKoala/purepursuit-builder>purepursuit-builder</a>, a Python program that automatically
generates the best pure pursuit paths through a series of inputs.
