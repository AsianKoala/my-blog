title: Building my Space80:Apollo by Graystudio

## Introduction 

I've been a keyboard enthusiast for several years now. Back when I built my first
computer, I bought the Corsair K70RGB, a standard, run-of-the-mill keyboard. This first computer build
ignited by interest in PC peripherals, later leading me to my first keyboard customization: keycaps. 
The physical keys that you type on are called keycaps, and are a popular modification. I purchased pudding keycaps,
a special type of keycap that allows RGB light to shine through the side "walls".

## A bit deeper
Around a year after the purchase of those pudding keycaps on my K70, I grew to be annoyed by the size of the keyboard. During gaming, my right hand would frequently make contact with the numpad of the K70, and during study sessions there wouldn't be enough room to lay out all my papers. Also, tilting my keyboard in order to provide a more comfortable resting position proved to be a challenge due to how small my old desk was. To solve this, I did a bit of research and discovered the <b>Ducky One 2 Mini</b>, a smaller keyboard containing only 60% of the standard 108 keys (only alphanumeric and modifiers), hence the given name for this form factor by the keyboard community as a "60% keyboard".

I found the Ducky One 2 Mini to be an excellent purchase, and miles ahead of the Corsair K70 I owned. The many subtle improvements on the Ducky One 2 Mini added up to create an amazing experience that the K70 couldn't achieve. For example, the spacebar on my K70 would frequently rattle as the stabilizers used were poor quality. Overall a great purchase and definitely would recommend.

Similarly to with the K70, I also bought keycaps several months after purchasing my Ducky One 2 Mini. The first set was the Ducky Joker PBT Double-Shot keycap set. In contrast to standard ABS plastic used in my old keyboard, these keycaps use PBT, a harder, thicker plastic that is much harder to shine. In addition, I also bought rubber keycaps from Tai-Hao which provided a better grip on the keys normally used for playing video games.

## Entering the Keyboard Community

This satisfied me for a while, but as all keyboard enthusiasts do, I eventually came upon the <i>interesting</i> subreddit [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/). Many people have differing opinions on the quality of this subreddit, but regardless, to me it served as a gateway into the hobby of keyboards. Looking back on it, there is a lot of poor advice given on that subreddit, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people starting out in the hobby. As is always with reddit, there is an overflow of nastiness inherently springing from anonymity.

Anyway, I first learned about keyboards here. A multitude of guides, posts, tutorials and more are available on the subreddit that contain essential information to the keyboard hobby. I learned about the different types of switches (linears, tactiles, dome, alps, etc.), lubes for different levels of fluidity, (tribosys 3203,3204, krytox 105, 205g0), keycap profiles, PCBs, plates, dampening foam/stickers, custom cases, hotswap, soldering, and so much more.

This accumulated in me buying parts to build my first custom mechanical keyboard which I built in the summer before my freshman year at TJHSST. I'll be blogging about this in a later post.

Most recently, I acquired Graystudio's Space80:Apollo, an absolutely stunning keyboard. My experience with it has been nothing short of stellar, and I'll blog about this as well in the coming week after my tests are done. In the mean time, although low quality, here's a picture of the final build.
